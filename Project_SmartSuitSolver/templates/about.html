      <h3>What We Do</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Case Outcome Prediction:</strong> We use machine learning
          algorithms trained on historical case data (FIRs, judgments,
          precedents) to forecast possible results.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Document Analysis:</strong> Automatic parsing of legal
          documents (FIRs, charge sheets, judgments) to extract key facts,
          timelines, and legal provisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>“What-If” Simulator:</strong> Compare different legal
          strategies and see how changing facts or arguments may affect predicted
          outcomes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal Risk Meter:</strong> A composite score indicating time,
          emotional, and cost risk for each litigant or scenario.
